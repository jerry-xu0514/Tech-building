# Tech-building
hello~

This repository is **strictly** for things we do during tech building season. Make sure you familiarize yourself with github and have fun in the process :) As you go, remember these crucial rules of survival:

1. don't die
2. have fun
3. try and **maybe** learn something while you're at it
