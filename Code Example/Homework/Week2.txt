Sachi: Feedback page
	What do you need for that? Whats a quick and easy way for the readers to 
	leave a message right there on the website? What way is most accessible 
	to the group members? Email? Comments?

	Task: create a feedback page which users can leave comments/questions/feedback
	directly on top of the page.

Tony: Blocked hyperlinks
	How can you add buttons and put hyperlinks over them? Once you've done 
	this, can you animate the buttons? Have them do a quick and small animation
	once the cursor hovers over them? 

	task: create a navigation bar with hyperlinks to 5 different other pages.
	**Note** These 5 pages should all go to links with a navigation bar just like
	this one but looped back.

Nathan: Animations
	What animations can we add over our website? scrolling animations? For
	example the beautiful ones we see @ apple.com for their iphones. Or other
	animations on the side. 

	Taks: Try creating a website with animations.
